## Code & Syntax

We can use triple ` (back-ticks) for a block of code. If we want to hightlight the syntax, use the following examples:

````
```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);```
````

````
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
````

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

## Tables

```
| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
```

! At least 3 Dashes for it to recognise it as a table
